# README: AI-Assisted Coding Experience

## What Language I Chose and Why
I chose **React Native** for its ability to build cross-platform mobile apps efficiently with a shared codebase.

## How I Used the AI Tool
I used AI to:
- Generate React Native components with Tailwind CSS.
- Suggest optimizations for better performance.
- Provide UI/UX enhancement ideas.
- Assist with debugging quizzes and tutorials.

## Helpful AI Suggestions
- Improved component structure.
- Recommended **FlatList** for better list performance.
- Suggested animations with **Framer Motion**.
- Advised using **AsyncStorage** for local data storage.

## Suggestions I Had to Modify or Correct
- Some Tailwind CSS styles required manual adjustments.
- AIâ€™s state management recommendations were refined for better efficiency.
- Certain optimizations needed validation before implementation.

## What I Learned About AI-Assisted Coding
- AI speeds up development but requires human oversight.
- It provides valuable suggestions but isn't always 100% accurate.
- A solid understanding of the technology is essential to refine AI-generated code.

**Conclusion:** AI was a great aid in accelerating development, but manual refinement was necessary for optimal results.
